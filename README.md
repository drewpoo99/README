# Hello humans and other intelligent beings ðŸ‘½ðŸ¤–

I'm Drew Weaver, I'm a part-time web developer at Epic Life Creative and a CIS student at Messiah University! I enjoy cars, astronomy, video games and front-end development. My github currently hosts some code related to school projects as well as some projects I've tinkered around with in my free time. 

If you would like to see some client projects not on github, check out my [website](http://drewweaver.co). I'll be graduating college spring 2021, so if your company will be looking for a MERN developer either remote or in the central PA area, let me know!
